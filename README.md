# Technical Test - Last.fm

A short analysis project that I completed during an interview process. 

The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mcortesdf/lastfm) and is a (relatively) large set of information,
based on users listening data at Last.fm. It is 2.53 GB and is missing data in 3 out of the 6 columns, one of these 
can be fixed easily using information within the dataset; whilst the other 2 cannot be corrected.

This can be viewed, in browser, [**here**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brrrowun/technical-test-lastfm/blob/master/Technical-Test-Lastfm.ipynb)
